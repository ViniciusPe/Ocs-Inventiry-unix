DESCRIPTION
OS X [darwin] Readme

This README will help you roll your own native OSX, OCSNG.app client for enterprise deployment.

PREREQUISITES

- Latest XCode
- Cpanm
- Packages (Iceberg's successor)

BUILDING/INSTALLING

- Run `cpanm --install-deps .` in UnixAgent base directory
	- You might need to configure cpanm if that the first configuration
	- We recommend to install perl and cpanm using brew
- Move generated dependencies inside the lib directory of the OCS Inventory agent root directory
- Apply patches from macosx/patches directory
- Open the macosx/ocsng_app-xcode/OCSNG.xcodeproj and build OCSNG.app and ocscontact
	- Before building check that all the external resources are available otherwise the agent won't work



COPYRIGHT

See AUTHORS file. Ocsinventory-Agent is released under GNU GPL 2 licence. Portions of the Xcode project may fall under other, open licences (individual files will elaborate). Some of the Xcode project files are not core pieces of OCSNG and are to be treated as a supplement tool for building the agent for OSX deployment.

NOTES

- macosx tools was created by claimid.com/wesyoung and modified by OCS NG team for the 2.8 version.

- Once installed, the agent should contact the server and upload an initial inventory, then go back to sleep.

- OCS MacOSX agent is launched using LaunchD but you can click on /Applications/OCSNG.app to launch OCS agent manually.

- You can take a look to OCS MacOSX logs in /var/logs/ocsng.log file (by default)

- To uninstall the .app, use the uninstaller.sh script in /Application/OCSNG/Contents/Resources directory. This will kill the service, remove all the files (no restart required).

- This package works on MacOSX 10.11+ on x86_64 architectures only.
